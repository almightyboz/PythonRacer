# PythonRacer
Fun with Python and going fast

Based on the Ruby Racer challenge from Dev Bootcamp. To wit:

> The game is a race between two players. Both players start at the beginning of the track, side-by-side. Players take turns rolling a die and advancing along the track until one of them reaches the end of the track and wins the game.
